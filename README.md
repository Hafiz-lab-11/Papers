🧬 Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. Early detection significantly improves survival rates.

This project focuses on building a Machine Learning-based Breast Cancer Detection System that predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant using clinical and diagnostic features.

The system applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms to achieve accurate and reliable predictions.

🎯 Objectives

Develop a predictive model for breast cancer classification.

Compare multiple machine learning algorithms.

Evaluate performance using standard metrics.

Provide a simple and reproducible workflow.

📊 Dataset

The project uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, which includes features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

Features include:

Radius

Texture

Perimeter

Area

Smoothness

Compactness

Concavity

Symmetry

Fractal dimension
and more.

Target Classes:

0 → Malignant

1 → Benign
